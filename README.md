# WP Easy Role Manager

**Version:** 0.0.1-alpha
**Requires:** WordPress 6.4+, PHP 8.1+
**License:** GPL v2 or later

## Description

Easy UI to add, remove, enable, disable WordPress roles. Visualise and assign multiple roles to users. Visualise, add, and remove capabilities on roles. Also visualise the effective capabilities a user has based on their roles.

## Features

### Role Management
- Create new custom roles (from scratch or based on existing roles)
- Disable custom roles completely:
  - Users retain role assignment in admin for visibility
  - Role becomes invisible to WordPress core, plugins, and themes
  - No capabilities granted from disabled roles
  - Role membership checks (e.g., Bricks Builder conditions) return false
  - Visual indicators (red badges) when assigning disabled roles
- Delete custom roles (with user migration wizard)
- Core roles are read-only and protected

### Capability Management
- Add/remove capabilities from roles
- Disable capabilities per-role without deleting
- Visual matrix of Roles × Capabilities
- Filter and search capabilities
- Core capabilities are read-only

### User Management
- Assign multiple roles to users via Select2 interface on user edit screens
- Visual warnings when assigning disabled roles (red badges)
- View effective capabilities (union across all user roles, excluding disabled roles)
- Test capability feature:
  - Check if a user has a specific capability
  - Shows "Role Disabled" status for capabilities from disabled roles
  - Generate code snippets (Shortcode, PHP, Fetch, REST URL)
- Bulk role assignment operations
- User migration wizard when deleting roles

### Activity Logging
- Comprehensive logging of all role/capability/user changes
- Stores up to 500 log entries
- Filter logs by Action (dropdown) and Details (search)
- Tracks who changed what and when
- Timestamps in both local and GMT

### Safety Features
- Core roles and capabilities are protected (read-only)
- Typed confirmation required for role deletion
- Migration wizard when deleting roles assigned to users
- Activity logging for audit trail
- Rate limiting on bulk operations

### UX Features
- Single-page admin UI with tabbed navigation
- Autosave on change (no "Save" button needed)
- Status indicator (Saving… / Saved / Error)
- Filter/search by role, capability, user, and prefix
- Import/Export custom roles as JSON

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Bricks Builder Integration**:
  - Custom element conditions: "User Has Capability", "Specific User Has Capability"
  - Dynamic data tags: `{wpe_rm_has_capability:cap_name}` and `{wpe_rm_has_capability:cap_name:user_id}`
  - Respects disabled roles (conditions return false for disabled role membership)
- **WordPress User Edit Screens**:
  - Enhanced Select2 multi-role assignment
  - Replaces default WordPress single-role dropdown
  - Shows disabled roles with visual warnings

### Multisite Compatible
- Fully compatible with WordPress multisite
- Network admin tools for bulk operations across sites
- Safeguards against accidental network-wide changes
